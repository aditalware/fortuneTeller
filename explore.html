                The Sun card instantly has a feel good factor associated with it. There is nothing ambiguous or unclear about the emotion behind this card; it makes me feel instantly happy and optimistic. At the top of the card we see a big, bright sun with a benevolent face shining down on a row of sunflowers and a child on a horse.

The child is smiling and happy and waving a large red flag. The child is naked, which speaks to me of innocence and purity and sheer happiness and openness. He rides the white horse without a saddle, arms wide without a fear or doubt of his safety. The red flag he is waving seems to be heralding something new; combined with the youth of the child on the horse, also seems to signify rebirth and a new era. The sunflowers are also a bright, beautiful flower and are known to always face the sun. On a day like this, with the Sun shining brightly and feeling as free and happy as the child, it seems there is the potential for anything. After all, children are the very essence of innocence, optimism, rebirth and renewal. Everything is fresh and new for them.

                This is a very startling image and it fills me immediately with shock and horror. A lightning bolt strikes a tower, ripping it open and sending two people plunging, no doubt, to their deaths. The tower is tall and well built, adorned with a crown, which has been ripped off by the lightning bolt and we see flames erupting from the windows. The tower is burning and the man and woman who are thrown from it are well dressed in robes.

                This card makes me think of some divine retribution. The tower has been beautifully constructed and within it sit adorned, wealthy people. Yet in a second everything has been destroyed with one bolt from the heavens. Were they proud of what they had built? Sitting high within their tower, were they aware of the reality of the world outside? Had they lost touch with reality? Whatever happened, suddenly everything they had has been destroyed and they are forced to literally come back down to earth and start again.

                of my brain as I look at this card. I can’t seem to drive out of my mind the knowledge that I have about its meaning and just focus on the image. Perhaps this is because at first glance, the image doesn’t actually seem to show anything clearly.

                So, when a situation arises where an image seems confusing, the first thing to do is to look to the name of the card; in this instance it is the Wheel of Fortune. Fortune would indicate a positive or lucky occurrence, fate, luck and combine these notions with the Wheel and it makes me think of a turning wheel, of change especially as we see the different creatures around the wheel in the image. In fact the four winged creatures in the corners of the card, suggest the four different elements as in astrology and the tarot deck itself; we move through different elements, times and situations in our lives. The creatures in the clouds almost take on the appearance of angels, and they each have a book, as if they are writing or reading the destinies inscribed therein.

                The card is dominated by the image of a stern looking man on a throne; the Emperor. This man looks like he means business and is strong and determined. The fact that he’s sitting on a throne tells me that he is a dominant force and used to having things done his way. The long beard shows age and experience. He is wearing robes but beneath them we can see armour which tells me that he is willing to fight for his beliefs.

                Also, depending on how familiar you are with astrology, you may note, as I did, the rams’ heads on his throne, which are the symbol for Aries, which is ruled by Mars. Mars is all about action and ambition. This also confirms for me the leadership and strength indicated by the rest of the image.
                
                So looking carefully at this image, the story it tells me is of a man who is used to being in charge; his age suggests that he has had this power for quite a while and may well have set ways and routines. He is aware of his power and he is not afraid to use it. The armour that peeks out from beneath his robes shows that he is ready to battle and take on anyone who goes against him and his rule.
